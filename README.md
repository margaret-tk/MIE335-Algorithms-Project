# MIE350 Algorithms Project

The goal of the project was to find all non-dominated points in a multiobjective multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem using 3 different algorithms. Brute Force Enumeration was used as the baseline while Rectangular Division and Supernal Method are more efficient algorithms and were implemented with Gurobi solver. 
The algorithms were then optimized to reduce runtime and compared on large instances for verification.
