# MIE350 Algorithms Project

Finding all non-dominated points in a multiobjective multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem using 3 different algorithms. Brute force enumeration was used as the baseline while rectangular division and supernal method are more efficient. 
The algorithms were then optimized to reduce runtime and compared on large instances for verification.
